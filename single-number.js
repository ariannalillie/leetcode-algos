// Given a non-empty array of integers nums, 
// every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

// You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity 
// and use only constant extra space.

const singleNumber = (nums) => {

const nums = [2, 2, 1];
console.log(singleNumber(nums)); // Output: 1
